Hi, here I attach a brief description of how our system (LaRevue) operates.

First thing first, you need to run and build the index.jsp file as it will display you
the Landing Page of our system.

You can first signup to the system by adding the details required.
The email must be in the correct format (eg: user@gmail.com).
The password must be at least 8 characters long.

Then, after you have succesfully registered your account, you can now login the system.
To login the system, please make sure that your email and password are both correct.
Or else, an error message will be displayed for the incorrect email and/or password.

Now, you will be directed to the Dashboard page of the system.
On the header of the dashboard page, you will see 2 icons and 1 button.
The first icon which is the cafe icon can be clicked if you wish to add a new cafe to the system.
The second icon which is the user icon can be clicked if you wish to view, edit or delete your profile details.
Meanwhile, the logout button will direct you to the Signup and Login page.

Under the header of the dashboard page, you will be able to see three buttons which are
1. Cafe button - to view, edit and delete your cafe details.
2. Review button - to view, edit and delete your review details.
3. Feedback button - if you haven't write any feedback to the system, you will be able to
write the feedback, but if you have already written the feedback, you can now  view, edit and delete the feedback.
(This is because, a user can only write a feedback to the system [1..1 to 1..1]) 

Under the three buttons you will be able to view the list of cafes registered and created by every users in this system
that is displayed inside the card.

Inside the card, by clicking the cafe name, you will be able to write a review to the particular cafe.
But, once you have written the review, clicking the cafe name will bring you to the list of your written reviews (same as when you click the Review button).
(This is because, a user can only write once for the particular cafe [1 cafe, 1 review owned by that user] but [1 cafe, many reviews from different users]).

On the same card, by clicking the number of reviews, you will be able to see all the reviews written by all users.

As you have go through all the operations above, you are indirectly have already experience every CRUD process for the four modules in this LaRevue System.
Module 1: Profile
Module 2: Cafe
Module 3: Review
Module 4: System Feedback

Warm Regards,
Group 7 <3
